Python Operators:
What will be the output of print(10+5)?

Output: 15
Multiply 10 with 5, and print the result.

Output: 50
Divide 10 by 2, and print the result.

Output: 5.0
Display Yes, apples are a fruit! using print()

Output: Yes, apples are a fruit!
Initialize a to 9 and b to 4. Use Python arithmetic operators to: Store the result of adding a to b in add, the difference of a and b in sub, the product of a and b in mul, the division of a by b in div1, the quotient of dividing a by b in div2, the remainder of dividing a by b in mod and the result of raising a to the power of b in p.

Initialize expr to the result of adding 10 to the product of 20 and 30. Display the value of expr.

Output: 610
What will be the output of print(100 / 10 * 10), print(5- 2 + 3), print(5 - (2 + 3)), print(2 ** 3 ** 2)?

Output of print(100 / 10 * 10): 100
Output of print(5- 2 + 3): 6
Output of print(5 - (2 + 3)): 0
Output of print(2 ** 3 ** 2): 512
Python Variables and Types:
Which of the following declarations are valid?
9lives=9
flag=0
_9lives='cat'
year2='Sophomore'
